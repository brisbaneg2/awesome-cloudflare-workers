DO NOT submit a Pull Request or open an issue to add a new link, please use the [Suggestion Form here](https://airtable.com/shr1cr5TqmnwuQU3W).

All the links are built via a script I built off the CSV dump from an Airtable, so you can't edit those.  You can edit other files (src/preamble, etc) if you see a typo, etc.
